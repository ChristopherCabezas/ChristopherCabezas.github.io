<p>I am a currently postdoc researcher at the <a href="https://www.mathematics.uliege.be/cms/c_4179137/fr/mathematics">Department of Mathematics</a> at Université de Liège, Liège, Belgium.</p>
  
In September 2022, I received my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.lamfa.u-picardie.fr/">LAMFA</a> from Université de Picardie Jules Verne under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lamfa.u-picardie.fr/petite/">Samuel Petite</a>. In May 2019, I completed the <a href="https://master-math-fonda.imj-prg.fr/">Master 2 of Fundamental Mathematics</a> at Sorbonne Université and in March 2018 I completed a Master's degree at <a href="https://www.dim.uchile.cl/en/home/">Department of Mathematical Engineering</a> (Universidad de Chile) under the direction of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/amaass/home">Alejandro Maass. 

Since January 2023, I organize the Discrete Mathematics's seminar at Université de Liège.
  
<p>My research interests are mainly centered in <u>Multidimensional symbolic dynamics</u> (specifically minimal Cantor systems), <u>Topological dynamics</u> and <u>Ergodic theory for Z^{d}-actions</u> and its interactions with different fields of mathamtics, such as <u>automata theory</u>, <u>combinatorics on words</u>, <u>finite geometry</u>, <u>fractal geometry</u>, and <u>number theory</u>.</p>
