<p>My name is Christopher Cabezas, and I am a Ph.D. student at the Universit√© de Picardie Jules Verne in Amiens, France.</p>

<p>My research interests are mainly centered in Multidimensional symbolic dynamics, Topological dynamics and Ergodic theory for Z^{d}-actions and its interactions with different fields of mathamtics, such as automata theory, combinatorics on words, finite geometry, fractal geometry, and number theory.</p>
