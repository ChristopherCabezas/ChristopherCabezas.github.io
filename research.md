title: Microbial Ecology of Engineered Water Systems
---

<p> Microbial communities are an integral component of engineered water systems that are designed to improve public health, the environment, and overall water infrastructure and quality. Adequately understanding the ecology and evolution of microbial lineages underpinning engineered water systems will allow for better designed and more predictable biotechnologies . Since most of the microbial lineages underpinning these systems remain uncultivated to date, I use a combination of lab-scale enrichment bioreactor techniques and genome-resolved metagenomic approaches. </p>

<p> During my PhD, I studied self-assembled enrichment bioreactor microbial communities simulating enhanced phosphorus removal (EBPR), an important biological wastewater treatment technology. EPBR processes harness the unique metabolic capabilities of phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) and remove orthophosphate through incorporating chains of polyphosphate into their biomass. A model PAO is '<i>Candidatus</i> Accumulibacter phosphatis', which can be readily enriched for in lab-scale bioreactors. However, these bioreactors also host a diverse "flanking community." I aimed to characterize ecological interactions and evolutionary dynamics of these bioreactor communities in the context of ecosystem function.</p>

<p>Incorporating insights from the basic microbial ecology of these systems with engineering principles will allow for more malleable systems for predictable outcomes. I am also passionate about open and reproducible tools and analyses in bioinformatics and metagenomics research.</p>
