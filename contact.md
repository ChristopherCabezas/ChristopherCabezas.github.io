The best way to contact me is at the email address above. For peer-review requests, I am happy to review manuscripts submitted to journals broadly in the field of microbial ecology with a minimum 2-week turnaround time. My specific expertise spans environmental microbiology, microbial ecology of engineered water systems, and multi-omics approaches (specifically genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics).
